This gallery provides a big amount of samples for frames/videos captured with Raspberry cameras (v1 and v2) by techniques described in this webpage:  
https://stamm-wilbrandt.de/en/Raspberry_camera.html
  * microscope with resolution down to 0.1&micro;m/px
  * high framerate v2 camera raspivid capturing (up to 200fps)
  * high framerate raspiraw capturing (up to 666fps/1007fps for v1/v2 camera)
  * global external shutter for v1 camera
  * ...

Animations extracted from youtube videos by https://makeagif.com/youtube-to-gif tool are typically reduced in resolution a bit; follow the link to related posting for original video. Maximal (free) animation duration by that tool is 10s, lookup original video if animation is only a part.

Samples are sorted alphabetically by subject area:
